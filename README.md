EM Algorithm In Image Segmentation

---

In this project, we built two unsupervised models to do the image segmentation, the K-means algorithm and the Expectation-Maximization procedure (the Gaussian
Mixture Model). Our result shows that the K-means algorithm works faster, but in general, Em is a better procedure because it can address two primary shortcomings
of K-means, inflexible cluster shape and qualitative only estimate of a data point belonging to a cluster. We can use K-means to generate the initial Gaussian
parameters for the input of the EM algorithm.
